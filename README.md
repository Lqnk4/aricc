# aricc

A minimal c compiler with big dreams

This project was inspired by the CompCert C compiler, which has been formally
verified using proof assistants and implements a large subset of the C11
language. The objective of this project is similar, to compile a respectable
subset of the C language under strict formal verification using the Rocq proof
assistant, ensuring resulting programs are not subject to miscompilations
and will behave in exact accordance with the C language specifications.
