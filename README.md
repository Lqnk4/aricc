# aricc

A minimal c compiler targetting x86-64 GNU assembly

This project was inspired by the CompCert C compiler, which has been formally
verified using proof assistants and implements a large subset of the C11
language. The objective of this compiler is similar, attempting a formal
verification of the code generation section of the compiler.
